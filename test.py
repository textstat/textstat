            "playing games is every bit as important for adults "
            "as for children. Not only is taking time out to "
            "play games with our children and other adults "

            "friend. I asked him why in the world he had given "
            "us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an "
            "important aspect of marriage was for a couple to "
            "never quit playing games together. Over the years, "
            "as I have come to purchase and play, with other "
            "couples & coworkers, many games like: Monopoly, "
            "Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks, & "

            "\"shut-off the T.V. and do something more "
            "stimulating\" weeks. They have enriched my life and "
            "made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults "
            "forget that games even exist and have put them "
            "away in the cupboards, forgotten until the "
            "grandchildren come over.\n"

            "in life; the fun that can be the reward of "
            "enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It "

            "without much of it. Playing games allows us to: "
            "relax, learn something new and stimulating, "
            "interact with people on a different more "
            "comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening "
