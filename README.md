## Usage

```python
>>> import textstat

>>> test_data = (
    "Playing games has always been thought to be important to "
    "the development of well-balanced and creative children; "
    "however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives "
    "of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe "
    "that playing games is every bit as important for adults "
    "as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games "
    "with our children and other adults valuable to building "
    "interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way "
    "to release built up tension."
)

>>> textstat.flesch_reading_ease(test_data)
>>> textstat.smog_index(test_data)
>>> textstat.flesch_kincaid_grade(test_data)
>>> textstat.coleman_liau_index(test_data)
>>> textstat.automated_readability_index(test_data)
>>> textstat.dale_chall_readability_score(test_data)
>>> textstat.difficult_words(test_data)
>>> textstat.linsear_write_formula(test_data)
>>> textstat.gunning_fog(test_data)
>>> textstat.text_standard(test_data)
```

The argument (text) for all the defined functions remains the same -
i.e the text for which statistics need to be calculated.

## List of Functions

### Syllable Count

```python
textstat.syllable_count(text, lang='en_US')
```

Returns the number of syllables present in the given text.

Uses the Python module [Pyphen](https://github.com/Kozea/Pyphen)
for syllable calculation. Optional `lang` specifies to
Pyphen which language dictionary to use.

Default is `'en_US'`, `'en_GB'` will also work.


### Lexicon Count

```python
textstat.lexicon_count(text, removepunct=True)
```

Calculates the number of words present in the text.
Optional `removepunct` specifies whether we need to take
punctuation symbols into account while counting lexicons.
Default value is `True`, which removes the punctuation
before counting lexicon items.

### Sentence Count

```python
textstat.sentence_count(text)
```

Returns the number of sentences present in the given text.


### The Flesch Reading Ease formula

```python
textstat.flesch_reading_ease(text)
```

Returns the Flesch Reading Ease Score.

The following table can be helpful to assess the ease of
readability in a document.

The table is an _example_ of values. While the
maximum score is 121.22, there is no limit on how low
the score can be. A negative score is valid.

| Score |    Difficulty     |
|-------|-------------------|
|90-100 | Very Easy         |
| 80-89 | Easy              |
| 70-79 | Fairly Easy       |
| 60-69 | Standard          |
| 50-59 | Fairly Difficult  |
| 30-49 | Difficult         |
| 0-29  | Very Confusing    |

### The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

```python
textstat.flesch_kincaid_grade(text)
```

Returns the Flesch-Kincaid Grade of the given text. This is a grade
formula in that a score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be able to
read the document.

### The Fog Scale (Gunning FOG Formula)

```python
textstat.gunning_fog(text)
```

Returns the FOG index of the given text. This is a grade formula in that
a score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be able to read the document.

### The SMOG Index

```python
textstat.smog_index(text)
```

Returns the SMOG index of the given text. This is a grade formula in that
a score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be able to read the document.

Texts of fewer than 30 sentences are statistically invalid, because
the SMOG formula was normed on 30-sentence samples. textstat requires atleast
3 sentences for a result.

### Automated Readability Index

```python
textstat.automated_readability_index(text)
```

Returns the ARI (Automated Readability Index) which outputs
a number that approximates the grade level needed to
comprehend the text.

For example if the ARI is 6.5, then the grade level to comprehend
the text is 6th to 7th grade.

### The Coleman-Liau Index

```python
textstat.coleman_liau_index(text)
```

Returns the grade level of the text using the Coleman-Liau Formula. This is
a grade formula in that a score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be
able to read the document.

> Further reading on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index)

### Linsear Write Formula

```python
textstat.linsear_write_formula(text)
```

Returns the grade level using the Linsear Write Formula. This is
a grade formula in that a score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be
able to read the document.

### Dale-Chall Readability Score

```python
textstat.dale_chall_readability_score(text)
```

Different from other tests, since it uses a lookup table
of the most commonly used 3000 English words. Thus it returns
the grade level using the New Dale-Chall Formula.

| Score       |  Understood by                                |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|4.9 or lower | average 4th-grade student or lower            |
|  5.0–5.9    | average 5th or 6th-grade student              |
|  6.0–6.9    | average 7th or 8th-grade student              |
|  7.0–7.9    | average 9th or 10th-grade student             |
|  8.0–8.9    | average 11th or 12th-grade student            |
|  9.0–9.9    | average 13th to 15th-grade (college) student  |

### Readability Consensus based upon all the above tests

```python
textstat.text_standard(text, float_output=False)
```

Based upon all the above tests, returns the estimated school
grade level required to understand the text.

Optional `float_output` allows the score to be returned as a
`float`. Defaults to `False`.

### Development setup

> It is recommended you use a [virtual environment](
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), or [Pipenv](
https://docs.pipenv.org/) to keep your development work isolated from your
systems Python installation.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/textstat.git  # Clone the repo from your fork
$ cd textstat
$ pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install all dependencies

$ # Make changes

$ python -m unittest test.py  # Run tests
```
