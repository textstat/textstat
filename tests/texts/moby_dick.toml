For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded
White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the
Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few
of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet
had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing
to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were
sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously
pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a
whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling
sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the
irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other
circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the
whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings
concerning Moby Dick.
