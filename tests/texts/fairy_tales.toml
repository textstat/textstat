There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.
At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These
people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid
garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and
herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go
into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was
dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and
looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the
most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she
longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.
Then her husband was alarmed, and asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’
she replied, ‘if I can’t eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden
behind our house, I shall die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner
than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost
what it will.’ At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden
of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to
his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It
tasted so good to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it
three times as much as before.
