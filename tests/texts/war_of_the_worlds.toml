Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay was in
the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either
side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that
had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as
it began, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead
without misadventure about nine o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest
while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.
